# DynaMirror
DynaMirror is a tool used to assist in charting using Dynamaker by allowing for mirroring notes over a period of time.

## How to use DynaMirror
Start by loading in a chart file. This can be done by inputting the path to the file in the `in` text box, clicking the button next to it and browsing to it or dragging and dropping the chart onto the application window. Also set the output file while you're here.

Once you have done this you can start making "edits" to the chart. First, select whether this edit should affect the entire chart or just notes within a specific timeframe, using the buttons at the top of the window. After that, click one of the buttons corresponding to what action you want to do, Mirroring the left, right or bottom track or swapping the left and right tracks around. Clicking one of these buttons adds that edit to the queue.

Once you have made all the edits you want, click the `Check edit queue` button to bring up a list of all the edits you have added to the queue. These will run in order from top to bottom. Click the `Apply edits` button to run these edits and save the resulting chart to the output file specified.  
WARNING: If the output file already exists, it will be overwritten with no way to recover it.

## Upcoming features
I don't have time at the moment to make DynaMirror into the tool I want it to be. Several features are missing that I plan to add later once I have more time to work on it. These features include, but may not be limited to:
- Allowing edits to be modifed/deleted once they're already in the queue
- Allowing the left and right tracks to be swapped for a specific portion of the chart (rather than the whole thing) when they're the same type of track.
- Allowing a section of the chart to be copied and pasted elsewhere in the chart.
